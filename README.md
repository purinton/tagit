## Features

- Pre-configured for Node.js (ESM)
- Environment variable support via dotenv
- Detailed logging and signal handling via `@purinton/common`
- Automated version incrementing for `composer.json` and `package.json`
- Git operations: commit changes, tag with version and date, push commits and tags
- Jest testing framework pre-configured
- MIT License

## What It Does

`tagit` automates the versioning workflow for your Node.js projects by:

- Reading and incrementing the semantic version from `composer.json` or `package.json`
- Writing updated versions back to these files
- Committing the changes to Git with message format:  
  `"Version <version> - MM-DD-YYYY"`
- Tagging the commit with the version number
- Pushing commits and tags to the remote repository
- Logging each step with informational messages

This ensures consistent version management and smooth Git operations for your projects.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this template:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purinton/tagit.git
   cd tagit
   rm -rf .git
   git init
   npm install
   ```

2. **Update project details:**

   - Edit `package.json` (name, description, author, etc.)
   - Update this `README.md` as needed
   - Adjust license if required

## Usage

Run the version and Git automation script with:

```bash
./tagit.mjs
```

Or, to simplify usage, you can create a symlink in your system path:

```bash
ln -s /var/opt/tagit/tagit.mjs /usr/bin/tagit
```

Then you can simply run:

```bash
tagit
```

## Development

- Main entry point: `tagit.mjs`
- Core source files under `src/`
- Add or modify code in `src/` as needed

## Testing

- Run tests using:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- Tests are located in `tests/`
- Uses Jest for unit testing and mocking

## Customization

- Modify logging, signal handlers, or version increment logic to fit your needs
- Extend `gitOperations` for custom Git workflows
- Change supported version files or formats in source modules
